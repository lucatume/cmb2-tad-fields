#Custom Meta Boxes 2 additional fields

A very much draft code for some [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) addtional field types; right now:

* tad_select2 - a [select2](http://select2.github.io/) based select control
* tad_select2_action - a [select2](http://select2.github.io/) based select control with a button beside it
* tad_sortable_list - a [jquery-sortable](http://johnny.github.io/jquery-sortable/) list handler

actual code has been produced in a day and is just draft code. Still no fatals.
